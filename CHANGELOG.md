## 1.1.0

* `intent` - your one stop solution for android activity, can now get you back result from launched activity
* Can pick documents/ multimedia using their default activity, and get you back a `List<String>`, which holds result.
* There might be some situation in which you want to pick multiple documents, which is why `Intent.startActivityForResult()` returns a `List<String>`.
* Most important news, `intent` can capture image using default Camera Activity and get you back path to captured image.
